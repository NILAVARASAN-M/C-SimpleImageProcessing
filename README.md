## Description 📝

C-SimpleImageProcessing—a straightforward and accessible repository dedicated to demonstrating the basics of image processing techniques using the C programming language. Being a basic and fundamental language, upon which many languages like Python, C++ are built, we will see how image processing can be done using primitive functions in C.

## Installation 💻

No additional installations are required. Simply use a C editor to work with the provided code.

## Features 🛠️

✅ RGB to GREYSCALE
Converts RGB images to grayscale, simplifying image representation.

✅ Tresholding Image
Segments an image by setting a threshold value.
  
✅ BMP Images
Supports reading and writing images in BMP (Bitmap) format.
  
✅ PPM Images
Supports reading and writing images in PPM (Portable Pixmap) format.
## Clone and Use 📋

Clone the repository into your local system using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NILAVARASAN-M/C-SimpleImageProcessing.git
```

## Usage Instructions 🔧

Open the project folder and Navigate to `/sourcecode`.
You will find three files,

✔️ allimagePPMtype.c
It is applicable to RGB and Greyscale image, just convert any format image to PPM3 or PPM6. Run the code, and pass the path of the image in terminal.
[PPM converted](https://convertio.co/jpg-ppm/)

✔️ BMPTYPEcallbyFUNCTION.c
It is applicable only for greyscale images, just convert the format of the image to BMP, and pass the the path of the image in terminal.[BMP converted](https://convertio.co/jpg-bmp/)

✔️ BMPTYPEgenreral.c
This is the same as above file, just an another approach of doing for BMP image.[BMP converted](https://convertio.co/jpg-bmp/)

Just click on the files, and run on your compiler.
## FAQ

#### 1️⃣ Is the code appilacble only for BMP and PPM formated images??

Yes, since C-Elementery language, it does not have inbuilt functions like the other languages do have. So we have to convert images to either PPM3 or PPM6 or BMP.

#### 2️⃣ How can I view PPM images??

convert the PPM image to JPG format, and view. [PPM viewer](https://convertio.co/ppm-jpg/)
## Other Material

Apart from the code PPT and a detailed-report is also provided `presentation_ppt` and `report_pdf`. You can refer the files for detailed insights in the topic and the code.
